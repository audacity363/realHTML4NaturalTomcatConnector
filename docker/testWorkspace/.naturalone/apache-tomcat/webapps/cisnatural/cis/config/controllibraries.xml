<!--

This is the configuration file for embedding control libraries into the
CIS page generation process. The file is not maintained by CIS
but by users of CIS.

Each control library must be listed with its package, io which the tag handler
implementations are contained. Each library has a prefix - this is the prefix
for the controls.

Example: a control library contains a control "abcde". The package name is
"com.xyz.abc.generate". The prefix is "abc". This means: durging the CIS
generation process the control with the tag "abc:abcde" will be identified 
to belong to this library (prefix matches), the generator will look for the tag
handler implementation "com.xyz.abc.generate.ABCDEHandler".



This configuration file does NOT control the way how controls of different
control libraries are treated inside the layout painter tool. This tool has
an own configuration (editor.xml) which should be in synch with the definitions
inside this file.
