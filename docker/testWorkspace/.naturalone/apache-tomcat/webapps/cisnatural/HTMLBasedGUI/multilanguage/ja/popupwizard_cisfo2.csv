Some valid values are "date, float, int, time, timestamp".<br><br>Dependent from the data type the text may be converted before being rendered.<br><br> Example: If specifying "date" then the output will be transferred from "YYYYMMDD" into a date display dependent format, e.g. "DD.MM.YYYY" or "MM/DD/YYYY".
_attr_decimaldigitsprop;Adapter property that passes back information how many decimal digits are to be displayed. Only used with the datat type "float".
_attr_fontfamily;This attribute specifies a priorized list of font family names and/or generic family names. To deal with the problem that a single font may not contain glyphs to display all the characters in a document, or that not all fonts are available on all systems, this property allows authors to specify a list of fonts, all of the same style and size, that are tried in sequence to see if they contain a glyph for a certain character.

wzcisfobimage2tag;The CISFO:IMAGE2 control outputs an image. Use attribute IMAGE to enter the image�s URL in a static way. In order to derive the URL at runtime use attribute VALUEPROP. In both cases the URL can be either relative (URL points to an image that is kept within your web application) or absolute (absolute directory path).

wzcisfopagenumber2tag;The CISFO:PAGENUMBER2 control represents the running number of the page within the PDF document. You typically place the page number within the header and/or footer of the document. By default the control also shows the total number of pages. Use attribute WITHTOTALPAGENUMBER to suppress the total page number. 
wzcisforeplace2tag;The CISFO:REPLACE2 is very similar to CISFO:TEXTREPLACE2. It outputs variable text in the same way like CISFO:TEXTREPLACE2. The only difference: CISFO:TEXTREPLACE2 represents a piece of text within a text block - CISFO:REPLACE2 itself represents a whole text block. The most important definition of the TEXTREPLACE2 control is the definition which Java Property is bound to obtain the text at runtime. The Java property is part of the Data Object - the counter part to the page (see attribute OBJECTCLASS of control FOPPAGE2).
wzcisforowtable2tag;The CISFO:ROWTABLE2 control is a container. A container is a table definition, inside the container you place rows, inside the rows you place controls. It is placed into a table container (e.g. CISFO:BODY2) and spans one row.

wzcisfostyle2tag;The CISFO:STYLE2 control represents a certain style. It is placed into the CISFO:STYLECLASSES2 container - directly below the page control (CISFO:FOPPAGE2). In the FO form you refer to this style by using the controls name (attribute STYLENAME).
wzcisfotext2tag;The CISFO:TEXT2 control outputs plain text. It is placed into a text block container (ROWTEXTBLOCK2 or CELLTEXT2). You either define the text in a fix way (using the TEXT attribute) or language dependent: in this case use the TEXTID attribute. The language is passed at runtime as property of the data object.
wzcisfotextblock2tag;The CISFO:TEXTBLOCK2 control outputs plain text that starts within a new line. It is placed into a text block container (ROWTEXTBLOCK2 or CELLTEXT2).
