<p><i><b><font size="5" face="Verdana">Welcome to the Control Editor</font></b></i></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can extend the standard control library with your own controls. 
	When do you need your own controls?</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You want to combine
    existing controls to form complex controls with certain dedicated tasks. Maybe
    you want to define an &quot;address area&quot; control which consists
    of a certain arrangement of fields and labels that form an address. 
    These kinds of controls are called &quot;macro controls&quot; - you take what is available 
    and group it into certain units.
    </font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You want to create new controls. 
    	Maybe you need some special kind of icon with a certain behavior.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You create your controls using the Control Editor. 
In case of macro controls, you can develop your control completely within the Control Editor - 
without any Java coding!</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Work within your own editor
extension!</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The standard control set is
defined in the file &quot;editor.xml&quot;. This file controls the way in which
controls are presented inside the Layout Painter. You define your own controls
in so-called &quot;editor extensions&quot;. These are XML files with the prefix
&quot;editor_&quot;. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When you invoke the Control
Editor, a dialog appears listing all available editor extensions. You can then
select your editor extension from the list. If you have not yet created your own
editor extension, you have to cancel the dialog. Using <b>File > New</b> or
the corresponding toolbar button, you can then create a new editor extension.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Important:</b><br>Never touch an editor extension file you do not own. 
Develop your controls within your own extension!</font></p>
