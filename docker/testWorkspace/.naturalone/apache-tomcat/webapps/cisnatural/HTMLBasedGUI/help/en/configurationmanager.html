<h2>CIS Configuration Files/ Upgrade Procedure&nbsp;</h2>
<h3><b>Motivation</b></h3>
<p>CIS Server comes along wit a set of configuration files.</p>
<p><b>Configuration Files</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>softwareag/config/cisconfig.xml</li>
  <li>softwareag/config/controllibraries.xml</li>
  <li>softwareag/config/controlwizard.xml</li>
  <li>softwareag/config/editortemplates.xml</li>
  <li>softwareag/config/startapps.xml</li>
  <li>WEB-INF/web.xml</li>
</ul>
<p>After installation of a CIS Server build the files contain the default
configuration settings. Typically you change one or more settings over time
(e.g. you change parameter session timeout in file cisconfig). Problem: you
loose this changes if you (re-)install a CIS Server build over the existing
installation. </p>
<h3>The former upgrade procedure</h3>
<p>Up to release 2.5 there was no secure (re-)installation over an existing
installation. The standard work around: you&nbsp; did not (re-)install a CIS Server
build over an existing installation. The new build was installed into a separate
directory with a certain take over procedure (copy/ paste) of the new resources
into the existing installation. With that procedure two new problems were coming
up: </p>
<ol>
  <li>No Complete Take Over<br>
    Sometimes only parts of the new CIS Server resources were took over. With
    that you got a buggy mix out of the new and old CIS Server build. <br>
  </li>
  <li>No Take Over of new Configuration Settings<br>
    CIS may update the configuration files. Especially if you install a new
    release there is a high change that our configuration files has changed.
    For example: with release 2.5 we added a servlet &quot;<font SIZE="2">StartMessagePage&quot;</font>.
    This servlet must be registered within your web.xml. Often the configuration
    updates were not take over to the existing installation.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Configuration Manager</h3>
<p>The Configuration Manager is a tool to ensure a secure upgrade of an existing
CIS Server installation. Use the Configuration Manager to directly install a new
build over an existing installation. We recommend making you familiar with
this upgrade procedure on a dummy installation first. Please follow the
following instruction closely:</p>
<h4><b>Step 1: Create Safety Copies</b></h4>
<p>Before installation of the new build create a safety copy of each
configuration file. Use menu item &quot;File -&gt; Create Safety Copies&quot;
within the drop down menu inside the page header. </p>
<p align="center"><br>

<br>
<b>Create Safety Copies</b> </p>
<p>The name of a safety copy is built out of the name of the origin file plus an
additional extension (timestamp of creation). The safety copy is stored within
the directory of the origin file. The File Overview Screen will show the new
copies at once. Shutdown your application server.</p>
<h4><b>Step 2: Install new build</b></h4>
<p>Extract the new build over the existing installation. Your config files are
replaced by the CIS ones. The safety copies will still exist.<br>
</p>
<h4><b>Step 3: Merge Current File with Safety Copy</b></h4>
<p>For each configuration file check if there are differences between the
current file and the safety copy. If there are differences: the safety copy
contains your settings - the current file contains the CIS ones. Now take
over your settings into the current configuration file (file merge). The
Configuration Manager supports this step (certainly you can use your own file
merge tool). Within the File Overview click the safety copy with the right mouse
button. A popup menu appears. </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="configmgr_fileoverview.gif"><br>
<br>
<b>Switch to File Compare Screen</b></p>
<p>Select &quot;Compare&quot; to switch into the File Compare Screen. At the left hand you see the current file - at the right hand the safety
copy. To see differences click button &quot;View Differences&quot; at the
bottom of the page. A file diff popup appears.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="configmgr_diff.gif" width="610" height="84"><br>
<br>
<b>File Diff Popup</b></p>
<p align="left">The file diff popup just highlights differences (you see the default
session timeout is 1 hour, your old configuration was 2 hours). To take over your
settings close the popup. The current file content (left hand) is changeable.
Take over your settings (change value to back to 7200) and save. </p>
