<p>There are two types of WAR generation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>WAR with reference to the file system</li>
  <li>WAR without reference to the file system</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(1) WAR with Reference to the File System</b></p>
<p>This is the standard mode in which the Application Designer is delivered:
inside the WAR's web.xml file there are references to the web application's root
inside the file system and to the location where log files are written. The
development functions of Application Designer (such as the Layout Painter) require access to
the file system and as consequence know where to read and write files. In
addition the Application Designer class loader that simplifies development accesses
application classes through the file system (projects' appclasses- directory).</p>
<p>This mode is &quot;ideal&quot; for development but has some disadvantages in
clustered runtime scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With some applicaitons servers you do not know the location of the
    deployed files - or better: you should not know at all!</li>
  <li>In clustered scenarios you would require to have one directory that is the
    same for all cluster nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(2) WAR without Reference to the File System</b></p>
<p>This is the &quot;preferred&quot; deployment mode for applications. All
resources are not read from the file system but are read via the servlet
engine's web resource reader. The log is written into the log of the servlet
engine as well. Classes are not read via a Application Designer class loader but are read
from the WEB-INF/classes or WEB-INF/lin directory.</p>
<p>There are no things to be aware of from Application Designer side when runnning the
application in an application server cluster.</p>
<p>When creating the WAR file in this mode then the following activities are
implicitly done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>cisconfig.xml is adapted not to use the Application Designer class loader and not to
    start an own monitoring thread</li>
  <li>all class files in &lt;project&gt;/appclasses/classes are brought to
    WEB-INF/classes, all files in &lt;project&gt;/appclasses/lib are brought to
    WEB-INF/lib</li>
</ul>
