<b><font face="Verdana" size="3">A Control</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> ... </font> 


<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
... consists of
the control's definition (<b>Attributes</b>/<b>Positioning</b>) and its corresponding
tag handler (Java class). Typically, the handler class is more or less a stupid sequence of calls to general tag handler
classes of the Application Designer framework. For <b>macro controls</b>, you do not have to implement a tag handler class.
You can define the inner structure of the control directly with XML.
In the case of really new controls, you have to provide for a
corresponding tag handler in order to generate your own HTML/JavaScript code. </font></p>
